title: "Computational Bioinformatics"

---

## Description

An introduction to the development and application of methods, from the computational and information sciences, for the investigation of biological phenomena. In this interdisciplinary course, students integrate computational techniques with biological knowledge to develop and use analytical tools for extracting, organizing, and interpreting information from genetic sequence data. Often participating in team-based and hands-on activities, students implement and apply useful bioinformatics algorithms. During a weekly laboratory session students employ cutting-edge software tools and programming environments to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## Course Objectives

Students learn to begin and complete an academic research project. In this task, students learn how to;
* Determine ideas for own research projects
* Locate literature for idea
* Determine research project goals and research question
* Assess scope
* Demonstrate feasibility
  + Create preliminary data, code, or a product. 
* Determine next steps in the project
* Write a proposal
* Other steps involved with research

## An Ethical Interest

Throughout the semester students will be exposed to famous dilemmas in technology which will arrive with discussions to encourage positive thinking in ethics. For example, the course will introduce students to ethically inclined concepts in the generation of technology. Such terms include liability, ethics, responsibility, privacy, information governance, data security and others.
